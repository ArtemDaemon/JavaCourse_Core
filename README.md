# Java Learning Project - Lesson 1
Welcome to the <ins>Java Learning Project</ins>, specifically designed for beginners to grasp fundamental concepts of Java programming. This project serves as a practical implementation of the first lesson in learning Java, covering various essential topics such as classes, exceptions, input validation, collections etc.

## Project Overview
The project is structured as follows:
* **Menus**: Utilizes menu-driven interfaces to allow users to interact with the program.
* **Classes**: Implements several classes representing different types of entities, such as animals.
* **Inheritance**: Demonstrates inheritance relationships between classes, such as the `Mammal` and `Bird` classes inheriting from the `Animal` class.
* **Polymorphism**: Utilizes polymorphism to treat objects of subclasses uniformly through the superclass interface.
* **Custom Exceptions**: Implements custom exception classes to handle specific error conditions gracefully.
* **Input Validation**: Validates user input to ensure correctness and prevent errors.
* **Collections**: Utilizes collections, such as `ArrayList`, to manage groups of objects efficiently.
